A simple program based on [AIOLCDUnchained](https://github.com/brokenmass/AIOLCDUnchained) by [brokenmass](https://github.com/brokenmass).

This program allows you to have the replica of NZXT CAM's feature called "Web Integration" that makes it possible to create your own web based integrations for the little LCD on the AIO's pump but on Linux!

## Device support
As per the [AIOLCDUnchained README](https://github.com/brokenmass/AIOLCDUnchained?tab=readme-ov-file#full-app-roadmap) the supported devices are NZXT Kraken 2023 Elite and NZXT Kraken Z3. PLEASE don't add eventual support for devices to this project. Hop over to AIOLCDUnchained and do it there.
